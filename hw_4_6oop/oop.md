### 2.What are the SOLID Principles?
2. Single Responsibility Principle.
3. Open-Closed Principle.
4. Liskov Substitution Principle.
5. Interface Segregation Principle.
6. Dependency Inversion Principle.

### 3. How can you achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java?
1. Create the private constructor to avoid any new object creation with new operator.
2. Declare a private static instance of the same class.
3. Provide a public static method that will return the singleton class instance variable.

### 4. What do you understand by the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)?
The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules, methods, etc.)
should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
In practice, this means creating software entities whose behavior can be changed without the need to edit and recompile the code itself.
