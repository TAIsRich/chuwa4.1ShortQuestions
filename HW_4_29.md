What is POJO and what is Java Bean? What are the differences?
=

1.POJO  
POJO stands for Plain Old Java Object. It is an ordinary Java object, not bound by any special restriction other than those forced by the Java Language Specification and not requiring any classpath. POJOs are used for increasing the readability and re-usability of a program.
  
2.JAVA BEAN 
Beans are special type of Pojos. There are some restrictions on POJO to be a bean. A JavaBean follows certain conventions. Getter/setter naming, having a public default constructor, being serialisable etc. 
  
3.Difference
Java make java beans objects serialized so that the state of a bean class could be preserved in case required.So due to this a Java Bean class must either implements Serializable or Externalizable interface.

What is Hibernate and why we need Hibernate?
=
Hibernate is an open source object relational mapping (ORM) tool that provides a framework to map object-oriented domain models to relational databases for web applications.
Hibernate reduces lines of code by maintaining object-table mapping itself and returns result to application in form of Java objects. It relieves programmer from manual handling of persistent data, hence reducing the development time and maintenance cost.

What is ORM? Why it is helpful?
=
ORM sets the mapping between the set of objects which are written in the preferred programming language like JavaScript and relational database like SQL. 
1.You use your own specific language to manage your batabase
2.It hides and encapsulates the SQL queries into objects and instead of SQL queries we can use directly the objects to implement the SQL query. It also hides query away from application logic.

What is Connection Pool? what is the advantage?
=
Database connection pooling is a way to reduce the cost of opening and closing connections by maintaining a "pool"of open connections that can be passed from database operation to database operation as needed.  
Connection pooling can improve the response time of any application that requires connections, especially Web-based applications.  
  
List all of the annotations about Entity.
=
The Entity Annotation:@Entity  
The Id Annotation: @Id @GeneratedValue
The Table Annotation: @Table
The Column Annotation:@Column
The Transient Annotation:@Transient
The Temporal Annotation:@Temporal
The Enumerated Annotation:@Enumerated
  
What is the JPA Naming conversation? (check below pictures)
=
The query method starts with find/read/get (such as find, findBy, read, readBy, get, getBy). When query conditions are involved, the attributes of the conditions are connected with the condition keyword. It should be noted that the condition attributes are capitalized with the first letter.

How many JPA methods you know, list all. (check below pictures)
=
findAll(): Return all instances of the type
save(): Saves a given entity.
saveAndFlush(): Save and update.
count(): Return the number of available entities.
delete(): Delete a given entity.
deleteAll(): Delete all entities.
deleteById(ID id): Delete the entity by given id.
existsById(ID id): Whether entity with given id exists.

How to write your own query with parameter?
=
Using @Param; Find a person with a given first name and last name using parameter.
public interface AuthorRepository extends JpaRepository<Author, Long> {
  @Query("SELECT p FROM Person p WHERE firstName = :firstName AND lastName = :lastName")
    List<Person> findByFirstNameAndLastName(@Param("lastName") String firstName,@Param("firstName") String lastName);
}

What is pagination? (check below pictures)
=
Pagination is often helpful when we have a large dataset and we want to present it to the user in smaller chunks.Also, we often need to sort that data by some criteria while paging.  
  
Design two entities and the repository
=
Employee(you can add more fields):EmployeeRepository
id;firstname;lastname;title;join_date;create_date;update_date
Order:OrderRepository
id;product_name;amount;unit_price;create_date;update_date
In your repository code, list all of the CRUD methods from JPA for EmployeeRepository and OrderRepository
  
```
