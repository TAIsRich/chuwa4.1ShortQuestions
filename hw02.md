Write the answers using markdown, and push your markdown files to your github repo, then share your repo link to me by Direct messages. Fork and Raise a PR to here:  https://github.com/TAIsRich/chuwa4.1ShortQuestions.git
You will be fired if you don’t do the assignments. we don’t care the quality, we only care you do it or not.
1.What is Interface and what is abstract class? What are the differences between them?
Ans:abstract class:provide common code for all subclass. Abstract classes define a set of operations, providing a common interface for the subclasses.
Cannot initialize an abstract class
Interfaces is a group of related method signatures that an object must define

Difference: Interfaces can only declare the methods, but the abstract class can declare or define the methods. Interfaces can only define static variables while abstract can define regular variables. A subclass of an interface must define all methods that the interface declares, but a subclass of an abstract class may not need to override or define all methods that its abstract class defines or declares.

2.What is the differences between overriding and overloading?
Overriding: same method name,same return type but definition can be different.
Overloading ：same method name but parameters type, and number should be different.
3.What is final key word? (Filed, Method, Class)
Ans:
Final class to prevent a class from being extended.
Final method cannot be overridden with a new definition in a subclass.  
Final parameter to prevent a method from assigning a new value.
4.What is Java garbage collection?
Ans: System.gc()   or  Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
Java garbage collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management. without garbage collection (like C and C++) must implement manual memory management in their code.
5.What is the differences between super and this?
ans：The this keyword points to a reference of the current class, it can be used to access variables and methods of the current class
The super keyword points to a reference of the parent class.  It can be used to access variables and methods of the parent class from the subclass.
6.Can we use this keyword in constructor and why?
Ans:Yes. Using the this keyword is because a field is shadowed by a method or constructor parameter.
7.What is Runtime/unchecked exception? what is Compile/Checked Exception?
ans: Runtime/unchecked exception includes programming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of an API.  
Compile/Checked Exception：The program cannot directly control by Invalid external conditions (such as user input, database access, network exceptions, file access and loss, etc.), exceptions other than Error and RuntimeException and their xsubclasses, require try catch processing or throws statement to throw exceptions.
8.what is the difference between throw and throws?
ans: throw in the body of the method,  while throws is at the beginning of the method.
Throw is used when an exception happens.
Throws exception is to describe the possibility of an exception may or may not happen in the method.


9.Run the below three pieces codes, Noticed the printed exceptions.  why do we put the Null/Runtime exception before Exception?
The reason why we need to put the Null/Runtime exception before Exception is that the more specific exceptions will be omitted if we handle the most general exceptions first.
