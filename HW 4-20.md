1. Inversion of control is a design principle where the control flow of the program is inverted. 

2. Dependency injection is a design pattern which implements IOC principle.

3. Constructor injection:
class DependentService {
    private final Service1 service1;
    private final Service2 service2;

    public DependentService(Service1 service1, Service2 service2) {
        this.service1 = service1;
        this.service2 = service2;
    }

    void doSmth() {
        service1.doSmth();
        service2.doSmth();
    }
}
	
	setter injection:
class DependentService {
    private Service1 service1;
    private Service2 service2;

    public void setService1(Service1 service1) {
        this.service1 = service1;
    }

    public void setService2(Service2 service2) {
        this.service2 = service2;
    }

    void doSmth() {
        service1.doSmth();
        service2.doSmth();
    }
}

4. Constructor injection is the main way to do dependency injection. Use setter injection when a numberof dependencies are more or need readability. Use constructor injection when object must be created with all of its dependency.

5. HTTP methods: POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

6. POST and PUT are used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. Calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.

7. URI contains both URL and URN to identify the name and location or both of a resource; in contrast, URL is a subset of URI and only identifies the location of the resource.

8. @PathVariable annotation is used for data passed in the URI. @RequestParam is used to extract the data found in query parameter.

9. HTTP response status codes are three-digit codes issued by a server in response to a browser-side request from a client. These status codes serve as a means of quick and concise communication on how the server worked on and responded to the client's request.
