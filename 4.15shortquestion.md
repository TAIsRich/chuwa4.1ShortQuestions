What are the types of design patterns in Java?
Java Design Patterns are divided into three categories – creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns including Abstract Factory Pattern,Builder Pattern,Factory Method Pattern, Prototype Pattern,Singleton Pattern.

What are the SOLID Principles?
SOLID stands for:
S - Single-responsiblity Principle: A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
O - Open-closed Principle: Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
L - Liskov Substitution Principle: This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
I - Interface Segregation Principle: A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
D - Dependency Inversion Principle: Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

How can you achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java?
There are four ways to achieve Thread Safety in Java.
These are:
1.Using Synchronization.
2.Using Volatile Keyword.
3.Using Atomic Variable.
4.Using Final Keyword.

What do you understand by the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)?
The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules, methods, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. In practice, this means creating software entities whose behavior can be changed without the need to edit and recompile the code itself.
