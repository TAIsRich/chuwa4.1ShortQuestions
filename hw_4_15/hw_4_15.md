1. What are the types of design patterns in Java? 
   
   Creational design pattern:Factory pattern, abstract factory pattern, Singleton Pattern, Prototype Pattern, Builder Pattern 

   Structural desing pattern: Adapter pattern, Bridge pattern, Composite pattern, Decorator Pattern, Facade Pattern, Flyweight Pattern, Proxy Pattern 

   Behavioral design pattern: chain of responsibility pattern, command pattern, interpreter pattern, iterator pattern, mediator pattern, memonto pattern, observer pattern, state pattern, strategy pattern, template pattern, visitor pattern 

2. What are the SOLID Principles? 
   SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob). SOLID stands for:
   S - Single-responsibility principle 
   O - Open-closed principle 
   L - Liskov Substitution principle 
   I - Interface Segregation Principle 
   D - Dependency Inversion Principle 

3. How can you achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java? 
   
   Use Eager initialization
   Use synchronnized method to control simultaneous access 

4. What do you understand by the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)?
   
   In object-oriented programming, the open-closed principle states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code. 

   The name open-closed principle has been used in two ways. Both ways use generalizations (for instance, inheritance or delegate functions) to resolve the apparent dilemna, but the goals, techniques, and results are different. 

   Open-closed principle is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented desing.
