1, What are the types of design patterns in Java?

- In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
  Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages. Some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.
  Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm.

2, What are the SOLID Principles?

- **S**ingle Responsibility
  - Each class should have a single responsibility
- **O**pen-closed principle
  - Modules, classes, methods and other application entities should be
    open for extension but closed for modification.
- **L**iskov substitution principle
  - Subclasses should add to a base class’s behavior, not replace it.
- **I**nterface segregation principle
  - Clients shouldn’t depend on methods they don’t use. Several client-specific
    interfaces are better than one generalized interface.”
- **D**ependency inversion principle
  - High-level modules shouldn’t depend on low-level modules. Both modules
    should depend on abstractions. In addition, abstractions shouldn’t depend on
    details. Details depend on abstractions.

3, How can you achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java?

- Using the key word synchronized in the getInstance() method can achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java. Like this:
  public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {...}

4, What do you understand about the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)?

- Modules, classes, methods and other application entities should be
  open for extension but closed for modification.
- Everything should be designed in a modular manner
- In order to change the behavior of the system the developer should
  not need to change all of the source code
- Ability to add functionality without changing the existing code
- A program should be designed and coded in such a flexible way that is
  easy to extend
- This principle allows achieving flexible software architecture
