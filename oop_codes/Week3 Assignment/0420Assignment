What is IOC?
	IOC is Inversion of Control: instead of let developer to control creating objects, Spring will take the control of creating opjects

	common case: developer ---conrtol--> objects
	IOC case: Spring(Framework) ---control--> objects

What is DI?
	DI stands for dependency Injection, is a way to achieve Inversion of Control

How many DI injections in Spring Boot? please also give me code example.(只给你能展示这几种方法的例子就行，不用写完整的代码)
	There are three methods to realize DI injection 	
	1. Field Injection
		Example Code:

		@Component
		public class NotificationSystem{

			@Autowired
			private List<User> userList;
		}

	2. Constructor Injection

		@Autowired
		public NotificationSystem(User user){
			this.user = user;
		}

	3. Setter Injection

		Setter is used in XML file
		public class UserService {

    		private MailService mailService;

    		public void setMailService(MailService mailService) {
        		this.mailService = mailService;
        	}
    	}

    	<bean id="userService" class="com.itranswarp.learnjava.service.UserService">
        	<property name="mailService" ref="mailService" />
    	</bean>


Which DI Injection is better way to use?
	Annotation is a better way to use. 

What are HTTP request methods?
	GET: The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using 	GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.
	PUT: Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.
	POST: A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, 			etc. using HTML forms.
	HEAD: Same as GET, but transfers the status line and header section only.
	DELETE: Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.
	OPTIONS: Describes the communication options for the target resource.
	TRACE: Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
	CONNECT: Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.

What are differences between POST and PUT?
	The POST method is used when you want to send some data to the server, for example, file update, form data, etc. 

	The PUT method is used to request the server to store the included entity-body at a location specified by the given URL. 

What is URL and What is URI?
read this article again and again and again PLEASE (https://danielmiessler.com/study/difference-between-uri-url/)

	URL(Uniform Resource Link): is a type of URI, locator, a name of resource with a protocol that tells you how to reach it
	URI(Uniform Resource Identifier): is a string of characters that uniquely identify a name or a resource on the internet. identifier, a name of the resource


What is path variable? and what is Request Parameter?
	@PathVariable
		Use @PathVariable annotation on a method argument to bind it to the value of a URI template variable.

		For example, if we want to fetch an owner id from the www.xxx.com/owners/123, we should map our method in the controller as /owners/{ownerId}:

		@RequestMapping(value="/owners/{ownerId}", method=RequestMethod.GET)
		public String findOwner(@PathVariable(“ownerId”) int ownerId) {
    		...
		}
	@RequestParam
		Use @RequestParam annotation on a method argument to access servlet request parameters

		For example, if we want to fetch an owner id from the www.xxx.com/owners?id=123, we should map our method in the controller as /owner and use @RequestParam to fetch the id

		@RequestMapping("/owner")
		public String handleRequest(@RequestParam("id") int userId) {
    	...
		}


What are HTTP Response Status Codes?

	1XX: informational response, it means that request was recieved and the process is continuing
	2XX: Success, it means that the request was succesfully recieved, understood and accepted
	3XX: Redirection, it means further actions must be taken in order to complete the request
	4XX: Client Error, it means request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be filled
	5XX: Server Error, it means server failed to fulfill an apparent valid request


Collect of API design

	Design a collect of APIs for simple YouTube contains below modules
	Search. we have v1 and v2 two versions.
		For version 1: https://Youtube.com/v1/search
		For version 2: https://Youtube.com/v2/search

	use keyword to search
		https://Youtube.com/v2/search?q=keword

	search one video between 04/01/2022 to now
		https://Youtube.com/search?q=item&created:after:2021-01-19T00:00:00

	search apple in category Tech or Fruit
		https://Youtube.com/search?q=item&category=tech
		https://Youtube.com/search?q=item&category=fruit

	pagination. if we got 100 results, we split it to 10 each page.
	and more if you can think out.
