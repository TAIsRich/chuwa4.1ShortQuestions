## 1, What is IOC?

- IOC is Inversion of Control.
- Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering which transfers the control of objects or portions of a program to a container or framework. We most often use it in the context of object-oriented programming.
  In contrast with traditional programming, in which our custom code makes calls to a library, IoC enables a framework to take control of the flow of a program and make calls to our custom code. To enable this, frameworks use abstractions with additional behavior built in. If we want to add our own behavior, we need to extend the classes of the framework or plugin our own classes.
  The advantages of this architecture are:
  - decoupling the execution of a task from its implementation
  - making it easier to switch between different implementations
  - greater modularity of a program
  - greater ease in testing a program by isolating a component or mocking its dependencies, and allowing components to communicate through contracts

* We can achieve Inversion of Control through various mechanisms such as: Strategy design pattern, Service Locator pattern, Factory pattern, and Dependency Injection (DI).

## 2, What is DI?

- **DI is Dependency injection.**
- Dependency injection is a pattern we can use to implement IoC, where the control being inverted is setting an object's dependencies.
  Connecting objects with other objects, or “injecting” objects into other objects, is done by an assembler rather than by the objects themselves.
  Here's how we would create an object dependency in traditional programming:

```java
public class Store {
private Item item;

    public Store() {
        item = new ItemImpl1();
    }
}
```

- In the example above, we need to instantiate an implementation of the Item interface within the Store class itself.
  By using DI, we can rewrite the example without specifying the implementation of the Item that we want:

```java
public class Store {
  private Item item;
  public Store(Item item) {
    this.item = item;
  }
}
```

- In the next sections, we'll look at how we can provide the implementation of Item through metadata.
  Both IoC and DI are simple concepts, but they have deep implications in the way we structure our systems, so they're well worth understanding fully.

## 3, How many types of DI in Spring Boot? please also give me code example.(只给你能展示这几种方法的例子就行，不用写完整的代码)

- Dependency Injection in Spring can be done through constructors, setters or fields.
- In the case of **constructor-based dependency injection**, the container will invoke a constructor with arguments each representing a dependency we want to set.
  Spring resolves each argument primarily by type, followed by name of the attribute, and index for disambiguation. Let's see the configuration of a bean and its dependencies using annotations:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public Item item1() {
        return new ItemImpl1();
    }

    @Bean
    public Store store() {
        return new Store(item1());
    }

}
```

The @Configuration annotation indicates that the class is a source of bean definitions. We can also add it to multiple configuration classes.
We use the @Bean annotation on a method to define a bean. If we don't specify a custom name, then the bean name will default to the method name.
For a bean with the default singleton scope, Spring first checks if a cached instance of the bean already exists, and only creates a new one if it doesn't. If we're using the prototype scope, the container returns a new bean instance for each method call.
Another way to create the configuration of the beans is through XML configuration:

```java
<bean id="item1" class="org.baeldung.store.ItemImpl1" />
<bean id="store" class="org.baeldung.store.Store">
<constructor-arg type="ItemImpl1" index="0" name="item" ref="item1" />
</bean>
```

- For **setter-based DI**, the container will call setter methods of our class after invoking a no-argument constructor or no-argument static factory method to instantiate the bean. Let's create this configuration using annotations:

```java
@Bean
public Store store() {
Store store = new Store();
store.setItem(item1());
return store;
}
We can also use XML for the same configuration of beans:
<bean id="store" class="org.baeldung.store.Store">
<property name="item" ref="item1" />
</bean>
```

We can combine constructor-based and setter-based types of injection for the same bean. The Spring documentation recommends using constructor-based injection for mandatory dependencies, and setter-based injection for optional ones.

- In case of **Field-Based DI**, we can inject the dependencies by marking them with an @Autowired annotation:

```java
public class Store {
@Autowired
private Item item;
}
```

- While constructing the Store object, if there's no constructor or setter method to inject the Item bean, the container will use reflection to inject Item into Store.
  We can also achieve this using XML configuration.
  This approach might look simpler and cleaner, but we don't recommend using it because it has a few drawbacks such as:
  - This method uses reflection to inject the dependencies, which is costlier than constructor-based or setter-based injection.
  - It's really easy to keep adding multiple dependencies using this approach. If we were using constructor injection, having multiple arguments would make us think that the class does more than one thing, which can violate the Single Responsibility Principle.
- More information on the @Autowired annotation can be found in the Wiring In Spring article.

## 4, Which DI is the better way to use?

The Spring documentation recommends using constructor-based injection for mandatory dependencies, and setter-based injection for optional ones.

## 5， What are HTTP request methods?

- **GET**，
  The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
- **POST**,
  The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
- **PUT**,
  The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
- **DELETE**,
  The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
- **OPTIONS**,
  The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.
- **HEAD**,
  The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.
- **TRACE**,
  The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
- **CONNECT**,
  The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
- **PATCH**,
  The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.

## 6， What are the differences between POST and PUT?

- The **POST** method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server. While the PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

- **PUT** method is called when you have to modify a single resource, which is already a part of resource collection, such as updating a record in a database. POST method is called when you have to add a child resource under resources collection, such as adding a new record in a database.

## 7， What is URL and What is URI? Read this article again and again and again PLEASE (https://danielmiessler.com/study/difference-between-uri-url/)

- **URL**: A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a type of URI that specifies not only a resource, but how to reach it on the internet—like http://, ftp://, or mailto://. Such as **https://gogle.com** is a URL.
- **URI**: A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that uniquely identify a name or a resource on the internet. A URI identifies a resource by name, location, or both. URIs have two specializations known as Uniform Resource Locator (URL), and Uniform Resource Name (URI). Such as **google.com** is a URI.

## 8， What is the path variable? and what is the Request Parameter?

- @RequestParam used for accessing the values of the query parameters.

```java
@RestController
public class OrdersController {
  Logger logger = (Logger) LoggerFactory.getLogger(OrdersController.class);
  @GetMapping("/orders")
  public String getOrders(@RequestParam(name = "since", required = false) String since) {
    logger.debug("Orders since " + since);
    return "Orders since: " + since;
  }
}
```

- The @RequestParam annotation supports the following parameters:
  - **defaultValue**: Default value as a fallback mechanism when the request doesn’t have a value or is empty.
  - **name**: Name of the query parameter to bind
  - **required**: Whether the parameter is mandatory. By default, it is true.
  - **value**: An alternative alias for the name attribute
- @PathVariable used for accessing the values from the URI template.

```java
@GetMapping("/orders/{orderId}")
public String getOrdersById(@PathVariable long orderId) {
logger.debug("order id " + orderId);
return "Order " + orderId;
}
```

- The @PathVariable annotation supports the following parameters:
  - name: Name of the path placeholder to bind
  - required: Whether the parameter is mandatory. By default, it is true.
  - value: An alternative alias for the name attribute

1. @RequestParam is used to extract query parameters  
   http://localhost:3000/api/group/test?id=4
   ```java
   @GetMapping("/group/test")
   public ResponseEntity<?> test(@RequestParam Long id) {
   System.out.println("This is test");
   return ResponseEntity.ok().body(id);
   }
   ```
   while @PathVariable is used to extract data right from the URI:  
   http://localhost:3000/api/group/test/4
   ```java
   @GetMapping("/group/test/{id}")
   public ResponseEntity<?> test(@PathVariable Long id) {
   System.out.println("This is test");
   return ResponseEntity.ok().body(id);
   }
   ```
2. @RequestParam is more useful on a traditional web application where data is mostly passed in the query parameters while @PathVariable is more suitable for RESTful web services where URL contains values.
3. @RequestParam annotation can specify default values if a query parameter is not present or empty by using a defaultValue attribute, provided the required attribute is false.

## 9， What are HTTP Response Status Codes?

- HTTP response status codes (or simply status codes) are three-digit codes issued by a server in response to a browser-side request from a client. These status codes serve as a means of quick and concise communication on how the server worked on and responded to the client’s request. These codes also include codes from IETF Request for Comments (RFCs), other specifications, and some additional codes used in common applications of the HTTP.
  - Informational responses (100–199)
  - Successful responses (200–299)
  - Redirection messages (300–399)
  - Client error responses (400–499)
  - Server error responses (500–599)
